# ðŸŽ¤ Event Ticket with Resale Royalty â€” Smart Contract

## âœ¨ What

A **Remix-friendly ERC-721 ticketing smart contract** that allows:

- **Primary sales** (organizer â†’ buyer) at a fixed price.
- **Secondary sales** (owner â†’ new buyer) with **automatic royalty** payment to the organizer.
- **No direct transfers** â€” tickets can only change hands via the contract, ensuring royalties cannot be bypassed.
 
This is a **self-contained** contract (no OpenZeppelin imports) so it **compiles instantly in Remix IDE**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why

In traditional ticketing:

- Organizers often lose out on revenue from resold tickets.
- Scalpers can buy and sell at inflated prices without sharing profits.
- Tracking resale transactions is difficult and often off-chain.

With this contract:

- **ðŸ‘‘ Organizers always benefit** â€” a % of every resale is automatically sent to them.
- **ðŸ§¯ Scalping deterrent** â€” royalty collection adds a cost to quick resales.
- **ðŸ“œ Transparent records** â€” every ticket issuance and resale is stored on-chain.
- **ðŸš« No royalty evasion** â€” all transfers are handled by the contract, and peer-to-peer transfers are blocked.

## ðŸ§± Features

- **Mint tickets** individually with a token ID and metadata URI.
- **Set primary sale price** for each ticket (can be zero to skip primary sales).
- **Buy tickets** directly from the organizer during the primary sale phase.
- **List tickets for resale** with your chosen price.
- **Automatic royalty split** when resold:
  - Organizer gets `(price Ã— royaltyBps / 10000)`.
  - Seller gets the remainder.
- **Prevent bypass** of royalty by disabling direct `transferFrom`.
